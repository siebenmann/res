== res: resolve IP addresses to DNS hostnames with validation

Res resolves one or more IP addresses to DNS hostnames, generally
validating that the resulting name includes the original IP address as
one of its IP addresses. If names are unresolvable or have validation
problems, this will be reported (by default, see 'res -h' for command
line arguments).
